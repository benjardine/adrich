      <h2>Bali has long been a tourist paradise, a destination that combines staggering natural beauty with a vibrant culture. <br> Now, thanks to Mulia, it has hotels and villas that are as luxurious as the island
        is magical.</h2>
        <div class="about-text-container">
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>The island of Bali is the pearl in the Indonesian archipelago, and one of the world's most desirable holiday locations. It's a haven of spirituality: an island of exquisite Hindu temples and ornate handmade crafts, the home of Gamelan music and Wayang puppet theatre. It's also a region of outstanding natural beauty: of lush mountains and awe-inspiring volcanoes; a place where coral reefs lie just beyond pristine beaches with sands that can be snow-white or jet-black. It's a destination that begs to be explored by divers, snorkelers, surfers, birdwatchers, cyclists and intrepid tourists.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>It's also, finally, home to a luxury resort that befits this natural and cultural paradise. The Mulia and the Mulia Resort & Villas were opened less than two years ago but have already won numerous international awards and commendations as one of the world's finest luxury hotels. The ultra-high-end Mulia offers 111 boutique suites and individualised butler service; the Mulia Resort has 526 suites and lagoon pool rooms, while you can take your pick from more than a hundred Mulia Villas, ranging in size from one to six bedrooms, all nestled amid terraced hills and private gardens.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>Occupying more than 30 hectares, these three resorts are situated in the luxury enclave of Nusa Dua, home to Bali's most stunning seafronts. Residents have exclusive access to more than a kilometre of private beach, with conditions perfect for sea swimming. There are also a variety of sporting activities on offer, from kayaking to tennis lessons, from a top-of-the-range gym to aqua-aerobics or yoga-stretching. It's also, finally, home to a luxury resort that befits this natural and cultural paradise.

        <p>Unique to Bali, the Mulia has been designed in an elegant contemporary manner, using a variety of stunning marbles, stone, ceramics and glass across the resort. All of which seamlessly flow through the resort's private gardens and expansive beachfront. <br> The Mulia also offers an incredible array of dining options including bars, cafes and restaurants which offer a rich variety of culinary options, including Mediterranean and Pan-Asian cuisine, with Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese and Indonesian influences. Expect everything from Thai salads to sushi; from barbecued pork to Indian buttered chicken; from Sicilian pastas to exquisite sorbets – all with the choice of luxury indoor tables or beachfront dining. <br>

          The Mulia, Mulia Resort & Villas is an ideal destination for couples – the resort even offers three unique venues for weddings, vow renewals or special ceremonies – but they also cater for families and groups of all sizes, with a state-of-the-art Kids Club in a dedicated area of the resort to allow families to enjoy maximum privacy.</p>
