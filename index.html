      <h1>Luxury and Comfort in the Paradise of Bali</h1>
      <h2>Bali has long been a tourist paradise, a destination that combines staggering natural beauty with a vibrant culture. Now, thanks to Mulia, it has hotels and villas that are as luxurious as the island
        is magical.</h2>
        <p>The island of Bali is the pearl in the Indonesian archipelago, and one of the world's most desirable holiday locations. It's a haven of spirituality: an island of exquisite Hindu temples and ornate handmade crafts, the home of Gamelan music and Wayang puppet theatre. It's also a region of outstanding natural beauty: of lush mountains and awe-inspiring volcanoes; a place where coral reefs lie just beyond pristine beaches with sands that can be snow-white or jet-black. It's a destination that begs to be explored by divers, snorkelers, surfers, birdwatchers, cyclists and intrepid tourists.

          It's also, finally, home to a luxury resort that befits this natural and cultural paradise. The Mulia and the Mulia Resort & Villas were opened less than two years ago but have already won numerous international awards and commendations as one of the world's finest luxury hotels. The ultra-high-end Mulia offers 111 boutique suites and individualised butler service; the Mulia Resort has 526 suites and lagoon pool rooms, while you can take your pick from more than a hundred Mulia Villas, ranging in size from one to six bedrooms, all nestled amid terraced hills and private gardens.
          
          Occupying more than 30 hectares, these three resorts are situated in the luxury enclave of Nusa Dua, home to Bali's most stunning seafronts. Residents have exclusive access to more than a kilometre of private beach, with conditions perfect for sea swimming. There are also a variety of sporting activities on offer, from kayaking to tennis lessons, from a top-of-the-range gym to aqua-aerobics or yoga-stretching.</p>

Guests are encouraged to follow their holistic paths with assorted massages, body scrubs, mud wraps and deep cleansing. You can relieve stress with the Mulia's chromatherapy system and its hydrotherapy pools, or enjoy the steam rooms and Finnish saunas. There is also Asia's only ice room, part of a hot-and-cold therapy programme in which clients alternate between steamy and icy environments, stimulating circulation and boosting the immune system.</div>

The Mulia also offers an incredible array of dining options including bars, cafes and restaurants which offer a rich variety of culinary options, including Mediterranean and Pan-Asian cuisine, with Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese and Indonesian influences. Expect everything from Thai salads to sushi; from barbecued pork to Indian buttered chicken; from Sicilian pastas to exquisite sorbets – all with the choice of luxury indoor tables or beachfront dining.</div>
